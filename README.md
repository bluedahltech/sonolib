# Sonolib

https://sonolib.onrender.com

Sonolib is a public api for sounds meant to be used for web audio instruments.

This django application is meant for managing, uploading, creating sounds and kits that have specific data models that can be consumed by online instruments.

We have loops, impulse responses, single sounds, frequency kits, multi sound kits, and wavetables. If you wish to add to the database, send a message and I can set you up with an account. Otherwise you can use the read endpoints however you wish!
